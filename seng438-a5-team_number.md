# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

The input data that we used was from Failure Report 4, and it was converted into an excel sheet in order to be used with C-SFRAT.

From using C-SFRAT, we were able to get the models and their comparison. The columns 'Critic (Mean)' and 'Critic (Median)' were used to rank the models. The models that had Critic (Mean) and Critic (Median) closest to 1.000 were determined to be the models that provided the best fit for the data.

So, the models with the best fit were IFRGSB (E), S (None), S(E), DW2 (None), DW2 (F), DW2 (E), DW2 (F, E), DW3 (F), NB2 (F), NB2 (E), TL (None), TL (F), TL (E), and TL (F, E)

To find the range of useful input data, we used Laplace Tests. As seen in Figure 2, the Laplace Test yielded 0 for all data points except for Failure Count 1. Since values between -2 and +2 indicate stable reliability, Failure Counts 2-15 is the range of useful data.

We then were able to get the MVF graph (Figure 3) and Intensity graph (Figure 4)
