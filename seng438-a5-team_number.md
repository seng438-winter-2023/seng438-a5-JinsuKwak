# Introduction

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

The input data that we used was from Failure Report 4, and it was converted into an excel sheet in order to be used with C-SFRAT.

From using C-SFRAT, we were able to get the models and their comparison. The columns 'Critic (Mean)' and 'Critic (Median)' were used to rank the models. The models that had Critic (Mean) and Critic (Median) closest to 1.000 were determined to be the models that provided the best fit for the data.

So, the models with the best fit were IFRGSB (E), S (None), S(E), DW2 (None), DW2 (F), DW2 (E), DW2 (F, E), DW3 (F), NB2 (F), NB2 (E), TL (None), TL (F), TL (E), and TL (F, E)

To find the range of useful input data, we used Laplace Tests. As seen in Figure 2, the Laplace Test yielded 0 for all data points except for Failure Count 1. Since values between -2 and +2 indicate stable reliability, Failure Counts 2-15 is the range of useful data.

We then were able to get the MVF graph (Figure 3) and Intensity graph (Figure 4)

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Reliability Growth Analysis

Advantages

      -Predicts the growth or improvement of reliability of a system throughout testing
      -Therefore it guides the testing process
          

Disadvantages

      -Doesn't tell us how to improve the reliability of a system

## Advantages and Disadvantages of RDC

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Since the assignment contained two parts and we are a group of 4, we decided that it was best that we divide the parts so that each part has two people working on it. For part 1, Maarya Ahmed and Hannah Son was responsible for getting this part done. For part 2, Jinsu Kwak and Jack Li was responsible for getting this part done. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Some difficulties we encountered was first getting the required software to download on various different operating systems . One person had difficulty in getting the software to download on their Mac. The instructions that were made to download the software were very unclear and most of us were confused for the majority of the time. It was also difficult to understand what exactly we had to do with the failure reports and how to format them differently so that the C-SFRAT software can read the files properly. But after talking around with other peers, we figured out how to convert the word document to be compatible with the software. Another difficulty we encountered was that the report we converted for the software did not work on some people's laptops but it also worked on my other peer's laptops. This created some problems because then we would have to use the other persons laptop and try to get everything done quickly. 

We overcame these challenges by testing all the software and finding one that worked for majority of the group and used their operating systems. By communicating with other peers, we learned quite alot about the software's requirements.


# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This assignment provided an importance of analyzing integration test data using reliability assessment tools. Some comments about this lab is that the instructions about which software to use could have been better since we all did not know what to do and which software is compatible with which operating systems. Another comment is that there could be more instructions on how to use C-SFRAT to generate the graphs that were required. There were also some confusion revolving around how to reformat the word documents given so if there were some instructions on that, that would be great.
